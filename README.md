## What is Chocobot Community Assistant?
Chocobot started as just a simple Discord bot for playing music, but has come to more broadly function as a general automation worker for some of my personal online communities. Chocobot exposes a Discord bot still, but is infinitely extensible, utilizing this Discord bot as an easy user interface.

## Features
- Discord bot
  * Customization for commands, views, etc...
  * Play music in Discord calls
  * Custom "Lobbies" Manual Online Presence System

## Getting Started
### Requirements
- A Discord bot token
  * If you don't already have one of these, go to the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/docs/intro) to create a bot and get one, or generate a new one
    for an existing bot

### Installation
Inside of your terminal, clone down this repository using Git, then navigate into it. From the root directory, run `docker compose up` to run the services in the included `docker-compose.yml` file.
